# Headline 01

One could argue that this is a paragraph. I would not argue against that.

```yaml
type: code
purpose: make everything awesome.
```

```go
func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello blog")
}
```

```powershell
Get-ExampleCmdlet -Type Awesome
```

## In depth point

This one paragraph is meant to get into the technical stuff. This is where stuff happens!
