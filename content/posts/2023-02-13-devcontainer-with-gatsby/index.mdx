# How to setup

To be able to serve all our engineer a simple way to update new blogpost on this Gatsby blog, I wanted to try out [Visual Studio Code Dev Containers]([https://](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) and I must say. It`s pritty nice!

Our blog is built on [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.com) with [A theme from Pitayan](https://github.com/remiks/gatsby-theme-pitayan)

## Pre prerequisites

You need Docker desktop and vscode installed on your system. Follow the quick setup guide [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial)

## Create folder structure

1. First create a folder named `.devcontainer` in your Gatsby root directory. 

## Create devcontainer.json

2. Create a new file named `devcontainer.json`

This config will also install necessary extensions in your vscode instance to work better with markdown. 

```sh
// For format details, see https://aka.ms/devcontainer.json. For config options, see the
// README at: https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/javascript-node
{
	"name": "Fortytwo Blog container",
	
	// Or use a Dockerfile or Docker Compose file. More info: https://containers.dev/guide/dockerfile
	"image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/javascript-node:0-18",
    "mounts": [
		"source=${localWorkspaceFolderBasename}-node_modules,target=${containerWorkspaceFolder}/node_modules,type=volume"
	],

	// Features to add to the dev container. More info: https://containers.dev/features.
	// "features": {},

	// Use 'forwardPorts' to make a list of ports inside the container available locally.
	// "forwardPorts": [],

    // Use 'forwardPorts' to make a list of ports inside the container available locally.
	"forwardPorts": [
		// Gatsby server
		8000,
		// Live reload server
		8000
	],

	// Use 'postCreateCommand' to run commands after the container is created.
	// "postCreateCommand": "yarn install",
	"postCreateCommand": "sh .devcontainer/post-create.sh",

	// Configure tool-specific properties.
	// "customizations": {},
    "customizations": {
        "vscode": {
          "extensions": [
            "yzhang.markdown-all-in-one",
            "DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint",
            "bierner.markdown-emoji",
            "streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker"
            ]
            }
    }

	// Uncomment to connect as root instead. More info: https://aka.ms/dev-containers-non-root.
	// "remoteUser": "root"
}
```

## Lets use a post-create.sh file

3. I am using a simple `post-create.sh` file to have more control of the commands that I want to run after the container has started.

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# Jump into correct folder
cd /workspaces/amestofortywo-blog

# Install Gatsby CLI
sudo npm install -g gatsby-cli

# Setup and install prereqs 
sudo npm install

# Increase node memory allocation
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=5096"

# Wipe all cache node_modules and package-lock.json file
gatsby clean

# Run development instance
gatsby develop
```

## Open container

Now, open your project in vscode and choose 

![Open folder in dev container](./media/open_container.jpeg)

You container should start building now, first time it will take some time. Next time it will connect right away!

vscode will actually let you know when the site us up and running. :D 
![Container ready](./media/container_ready.jpeg)

## Browse and build

Your Gatsby site should now be available on `http://localhost:8000/` and reload everytime you write something in vscode.
