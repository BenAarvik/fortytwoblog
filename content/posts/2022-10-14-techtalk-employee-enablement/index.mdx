# TechTalk - Employee enablement and training

Watch episode 2 with Briand Sanderson and Alexander Solaat Rødland talk about the importance of- and how to enable employees and ready the IT department.

Sanderson argues for the benefits of virtual training and some "snackable" portions of learning paths.

Alexander highlight the value of being presented questions you might not have thought of and the learning value in questions themselves.

The question is the key!
