## Whats an MVP?
The Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional) award is given to individuals who have demonstrated an exceptional level of expertise and a strong commitment to the Microsoft community. MVPs are recognized for their technical expertise, community leadership, and willingness to share their knowledge and experience with others.

MVPs come from a wide range of backgrounds and areas of expertise, including developers, IT professionals, and enthusiasts. To be considered for the MVP award, individuals must have a deep understanding of Microsoft products and technologies, as well as a proven track record of sharing their knowledge and experience with others through community contributions such as speaking engagements, blog posts, and forums.

The MVP award is given on a yearly basis, and recipients must reapply each year to maintain their MVP status. This ensures that the award is given to those who are actively engaged in the community and continuously demonstrate their expertise.
