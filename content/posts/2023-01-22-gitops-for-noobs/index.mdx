# GitOps for noobs

GitOps is a relatively new approach to application development that has been gaining popularity in recent years. It is a way to use Git as the single source of truth for managing your applications, making it easy to deploy, update, and rollback changes.

One of the biggest advantages of GitOps is that it allows developers to focus on writing code and not worry about the infrastructure or deployment process. This is because GitOps automates the entire deployment pipeline, from building and testing code to deploying it to production.

Another advantage of GitOps is that it allows for easy collaboration among teams. By using Git as the single source of truth, all team members have access to the same information and can work together to make changes and deploy them. This also makes it easier to rollback changes if something goes wrong, as all changes are tracked in Git.

Finally, GitOps makes it easy to scale your applications. By using Git as the source of truth, it is easy to deploy new instances of your application and scale it up or down as needed. This allows you to easily handle increased traffic and demand for your application.

Overall, GitOps is a great approach for application development. It allows developers to focus on writing code, provides easy collaboration among teams, and makes it easy to scale applications. If you're looking to improve your application development process, GitOps is definitely worth considering.
