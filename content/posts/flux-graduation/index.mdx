We are excited that Flux project has been promoted to graduation tier in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), a massive achievement both for the Flux toolset but also for GitOps!

Flux was originally built at Weaveworks, who coined the term GitOps, but was officially donated to the CNCF in 2019. New projects come in as sandbox projects, before getting accepted as incubating projects and finally become graduated projects. To move between these tiers, there are several criteria to ensure that the projects adhere to the foundationâ€™s standards, that it is vendor neutral and has a healthy number of contributors.

Amesto Fortytwo uses Flux for both internal and external projects. It enables us to deploy our solutions quickly and efficiently and is crucial to our success. We look forward to many years of continued use.

## What is GitOps

GitOps is an operational model that aims to simplify continuous deployment. It is mostly thought off as the way to deploy applications to Kubernetes clusters, but through extending the Kubernetes platform we can also automate infrastructure. To help people understand and adopt this deployment model, a working group was created in the CNCF that resulted in the sandbox project OpenGitOps. The first task of the working group was to define GitOps by creating these four principles:

1. Declarative
A system managed by GitOps must have its desired state expressed declaratively.
2. Versioned and immutable
Desired state is stored in a way that enforces immutability, versioning and retains a complete version history.
3. Pulled Automatically
Software agents automatically pull the desired state declarations from the source.
4. Continuously reconciled
Software agents continuously observe actual system state and attempt to apply the desired state.
