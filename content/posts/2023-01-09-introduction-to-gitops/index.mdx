# Live Event - Introduction to GitOps
Operations through Git is not new, but now we have the technology to realize what we always wanted. The GitOps pattern has matured over the years, from the initial definition to the major adoption by the community, and with the arrival of Kubernetes and the controller/operator pattern has made it possible to adopt GitOps in practice.

In this inaugural meetup event, we want to share our thoughts on the concept of GitOps, why we need it and how it can be implemented. It is based on the principles defined by the OpenGitOps project and is a vendor and platform neutral look at the operational model.

## Amesto Fortytwo presents
We believe that knowledge should be shared, which is why we will be hosting webinars on topics that excite us. This can be technical topics, discussions about work culture, and everything in between.
