Adoption of GitOps is still going strong, and this year we have seen two of the most used GitOps project graduate, and several [GitOps events](https://opengitops.dev/events) throughout the year. On a personal note, one of my highlights was becoming a [maintainer](https://github.com/open-gitops/project/pull/112) on the OpenGitOps project.

For us, GitOps is a vital part of how we operate, and it is the magic sauce that fuels our platform offering. Not only do we use it for application deployments, but by utilizing the Weaveworks [tf-controller](https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller/), we can create services using Terraform to automate our infrastructure deployments.

If you want to catch up on the current state of GitOps, there are many hours of videos from events held this year.

## Graduating projects

We are excited that both the Flux and Argo project has been promoted to graduation tier in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), a massive achievement for GitOps! 

New projects come in as sandbox projects, before getting accepted as incubating projects and finally become graduated projects. To move between these tiers, there are several criteria to ensure that the projects adhere to the foundation’s standards, that it is vendor neutral and has a healthy number of contributors.

### Graduation announcements:

## Where to get started

If you are wondering how to get started, or what a proper GitOps workflow is, we will be writing more about this in the near future. If you want to get help with GitOps or platform engineering in general, you are welcome to [contact us](https://www.amestofortytwo.com/contact-us).
